"""Shared by every Trigonometry topic: number formatting and figure drawing.

    fmt.py             clean, fmt and deg: how numbers are written on every page
    static/fmt.js      the browser copy of fmt.py (window.TrigFmt), loaded before each page's math module
    static/figure.js   drawing helpers on the Manim canvas: an equal-unit view, angle wedges, polygons, right-angle marks

Not a topic (no api.py), so the site build does not publish it as one.
