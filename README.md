# Trigonometry

The Trigonometry domain of [Ethan's NN](https://ethan-gueck.github.io/#nn): formulas built out as interactive pages, published at **https://ethan-gueck.github.io/trigonometry/**.

Flashcard decks in this track: Trigonometry. A neuron on the portfolio fills in once a topic here lists its card id in `cards`, and its **See how it works** button opens the topic's page.

## Layout

```
trigonometry/
├── <topic>/                  one folder per topic
├── core/formula.py           every neuron's mathematics, in flashcard order (empty sections until built)
├── shared/                   number formatting (fmt.py + static/fmt.js) and figure drawing (static/figure.js) for every page
├── tests/test_site.py        the site builds; topic cards are flashcard ids
├── pyproject.toml            [tool.portfolio-site]: site title and URL
└── .github/workflows/pages.yml   test, build and deploy on every push to main

Themes, styles, the page builder and the static API come from the shared [portfolio-projects](https://github.com/ethan-gueck/portfolio-projects) library (`general/`), installed from git.
